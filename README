a batman-adv plugin for collectd


# Installation

`make install` should work.

collectd is assumed to be installed with prefix /usr, but you can set
the `COLLECTD_PREFIX` environment variable to change that.


# Configuration

You should add `LoadPlugin batman_adv` to your collectd configuration
file and the following line to your types.db:

`batman_adv_origt		seen:GAUGE:0:U, quality:ABSOLUTE:0:255, hop:ABSOLUTE:0:281474976710655`

It is currently expected that `batctl o` can be run by collectd.
